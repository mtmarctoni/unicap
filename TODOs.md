PRIMARIES
- when selecting exercise to add to workout, improve the way they are selected, maybe changing the ExerciseCard to a smaller one that permits to list hem easili (ex: create a 'SelectedExerciseCard' maybe)
- in workouts, enable to delete exercises (add 'remove from workout' option in the menu)
- refactor [workoutId] page, extract the dialog and extract the logic with custom hook


SECONDARIES
- add more information in exercise detail page (more images, videos, links, desription, duration (workout duration would be the sum), etc)
- enable the user can upload images and videos to the exercise detail page

Reconsider in the future:
- change the exercise - workout structure in database. Separate data base exercise and exercie inside workout. The first one has the basis that can be duplicate it and the second one is the specific for each user and workout.
